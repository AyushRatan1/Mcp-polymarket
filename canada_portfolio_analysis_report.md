## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. HIGH CONFIDENCE EVENT: Mark Carney's high probability (94.4%) of becoming Liberal leader suggests maintaining or slightly increasing exposure to international banks like ICICI that could benefit from his climate finance initiatives.
2. HIGH PROBABILITY ELECTION OUTCOME: Liberal Party victory now at 78.0% (based on Default value (insufficient verification)) suggests strengthening positions in sectors that benefit from climate initiatives and ESG policies. ICICI Bank is well-positioned for this scenario.
3. HEDGING OPPORTUNITY: Consider hedging AAPL against 'US-Canada Trade Tensions' scenario (35.2% probability) through options or reducing position sizes.
4. CONCENTRATION RISK: Your ICICI Bank position (20%) represents a significant concentration. While Canadian political developments may have modest positive impacts, consider diversifying your financial sector exposure to reduce single-stock risk.
5. GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION: Your portfolio has limited geographic diversification with exposure only to India and USA. Consider adding Canadian assets to directly benefit from positive political developments rather than relying on indirect effects.
6. MONITORING ALERT: The Canadian Federal election cycle and Liberal leadership race should be closely monitored. Set up news alerts for Mark Carney's statements on climate finance and international banking regulation as these could provide early signals for adjusting positions.
